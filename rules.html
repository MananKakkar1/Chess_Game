        <h2>Rules of Chess</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The game is played on an 8x8 grid called a chessboard.</li>
            <li>Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns.</li>
            <li>The goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.</li>
            <li>Each type of piece moves in a specific way:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>King:</strong> Moves one square in any direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Moves any number of squares in any direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves any number of squares diagonally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves forward one square but captures diagonally. On its first move, it can move forward two squares.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Pawns can be promoted to any piece (except a king) if they reach the opponent's back rank.</li>
            <li>Castling is a special move involving the king and a rook. It allows the king to move two squares toward a rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king.</li>
            <li>En passant is a special pawn capture that can occur when a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn.</li>
            <li>The game can end in a draw under certain conditions, such as stalemate, insufficient material, or the fifty-move rule.</li>
        </ol>
