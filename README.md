# ♟️ Chess Game

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a browser-based Chess game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**! The main goal is to provide a classic chess experience directly in your web browser, complete with an interactive board and all the standard rules of chess.

## 🚀 What’s Implemented

- **Interactive Board** 🎨  
  A fully interactive chessboard where players can drag and drop pieces, view possible moves, and play a standard chess match.

- **Complete Chess Logic** 🧠  
  Implements all movement rules for every piece, including pawn promotion, castling, en passant, and check/checkmate detection.

- **Visual Feedback** 👀  
  Highlights possible moves and selected pieces, making it easy to play and follow the action.

- **Two-Player Support** 🤝  
  Designed for two players to play against each other on the same device.

- **Sleek UI** ✨  
  Uses CSS for a clean and responsive interface, plus custom piece images for a polished look.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Start the Game**: The board loads in the browser, ready for White’s first move.
2. **Make Moves**: Players click and drag (or tap) pieces to move them, with legal moves highlighted.
3. **Rule Enforcement**: Illegal moves are prevented; special rules like promotion and castling are handled automatically.
4. **Game End**: The game detects check, checkmate, announcing the result when the game concludes.
